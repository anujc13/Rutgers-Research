0,1. The deficit: The amount of deficit has an effect on the value of dollar and interest rates. The effect is we're buying more foreign goods.                                                     2. Unemployment: Unemployment is going to go higher unless deficit is reduced. The gov should make sure there is as little.           3. The decline of the north east economically businesses are moving out of northeast to the south west. The N.E. is losing its tax base.                                                          4. Balancing the budget I don't think there should be a law passed to balance budget. but the deficit should be limited.
2,"The national debt, high interest rates, the arms control and nuclear weapons is probably the most important. I don't think it's going to go down, I don't see how they are going to control it without raising taxes. Reagan never said what he was going to do that's what I don't like about him. High interest, hard for young people to get homes. Rich people getting richer. They control all the money. Nuclear arms, it is a problem I don't know how they are going to control it. I don't know the answer, it's serious."
3,"The budget deficit, defense, social programs. I feel the budget deficit is creating a host of other problems. Such as keeping interest rates high, effecting our balance of trade and these together, in turn, effect employment and job security. I think the national security is extremely important but I think a phenomenal amount of money is wasted in national defense. I think we can be strong without throwing money down the drain, money that can go a long way instead toward balancing the national budget and cutting the deficit. There have been to many cuts in too many social programs and many people who are victims of economic conditions  are left on their own. I don't think that's right."
4,The agricultural plight. The farmers are either going to have to get more for their good or something else well have and change. I don't know what that has to be done without increasing the final cost to the consumer and unions are pretty. Well in check now gotten under control and one big problems the careless attitude of a lot of the population concerning their obligation financially as well as normally. Bankruptcy has become an everyday word. It too easy and morally the public indifference to the elections and the critical differences in the campaign such as abortion. I despise people who take bankruptcy it a cowardly way out eventually. Lenders will refuse credit to anyone because they can not continue to loose funds and stay in businesses and if people are so determined to borrow money they should be just as determined to pay it back. I'm pro life.
5,"Influx of people costing government so much money to care for Vietanamian and mexicans, they are even getting cared for better than people who lived here 100 yrs or more. Distribution of wealth some old thing rich get richer and poor get poorer. No matter how poor they should have decent standard living. Good job can't buy home or support family like it should. Spending too much money on space. Loaning too much money to foreign nations when they should know there's no hope of return. Stirring up small countries in older to sell them (not legible) equipment."
8,"The deficit- how to lower the federal deficit. Foreign affairs- Nicaragua is in the news a lot. Inflation and high interest rates. I think military waste is a big problem which goes back to deficit problem. My husband sees a lot of that like the price of ladders they use which is the same thing and a lot cheaper at the hardware store. I think it's important now that the election is over to get together, everybody work together- mend the fences. I still hear a lot of hard feelings- argument about taxes- about whether Russia is a threat in Nicaragua, sending planes or not. Inflation and interest rates still too high and always fear they will go up instead of down."
11,"Unemployment -- people need work and jobs and they can't get them.  The reports say that unemployment is less now so they don't pay attention to the places that have.  Interest rates -- they are too high for homes and loans.  Older people -- their medicare needs to be worked on.  If an older person goes in the hospital, the medicare only pays a part of it.  They just stop there even is the people have to stay in the hospital a long time.  The elderly can't afford the bills and their families have to bear the responsibility."
12,"Our deficit which is god awful. Our perception overseas appears to be a little sell serving. Well in Lebanon we say one thing and then pull out, Grands was a bit of grandstanding I thought and a terrible one of in south america. I can't believe Nicaragua thinks we're joint to invade them and we should have some kind of relation with Russia. The nuclear arms race of course we have to talk to the Russia. The nuclear freeze is idealistic it won't happen in our lifetime. I'm very much against women not being able to have abortions when they want of if they can't afford them those are the most important."
13,"Imports, steel is down, anti industry down trying to break up the unions and coal miners. Imports the steel mills is coming in from other. Countries and we aren't working. all the japanese cars here. Japanese are taking over keeping our people from working. Unions bringing japanese with there anti mobiles and trying to break down our unions. My daddy was a [REDACTED INDUSTRY] my husband is a [REDACTED INDUSTRY] and they are just killing us taking our jobs away. The govt don't care they just let the foreigners take over."
15,"Hunger:  There are mostly children and older people without sufficient food.  People on Welfare:  I think they should all have a job from the government even if it means digging ditches.  The government should get them a job.  There have been too many people on welfare for generations.  Lindberg Law:  What happened to it?  We have all these children who are being kidnapped, raped and hurt.  The person doing the crime is found insane and let out in five years.  Peace:  We should try to control peace within our nation before we try to find peace out of our nation.  Indians:  I think the Indians should have more privileges than they do.  After all, they were our first Americans.  I don't think we should allow foreign people to buy land - only lease it for 99 years.  The drug problem should be controlled by instituting a clinic where users can be counseled and helped.  With a legalized clinic, the crimes rate will greatly be reduced."
17,"Nuclear weapons -- everything else is secondary.  Put a lid on nuclear war.  For every new one we build, get rid of two.  Build down instead of building more and more.  Get rid of bombs; get rid of tension with Russia.  It's a hopeful sign that they met in January.  Still they're not going to do anything.  We have to stop building weapons.  Poverty -- more people starving and living in substandard housing.  Illiteracy.  Crime -- the crime rate is phenomenal.  Laxity of the law; should do something about it.  I saw a guy on TV who shot a gun in San Francisco.  His lawyer said he ate too many Hostess Twinkies and got him off.  That shouldn't happen.  A lady held up a bank with a gun and they let her off to go home and take care of her two kids.  Makes you wonder."
22,"We must get nuclear arms under control -- it's very basic; we only have one planet to live on.  We have to live together.  We don't have any other planets to go and live on.  We have to control arms.  It's like my dad can beat up yours.  I have a little one that I want to grow up.  Get taxes settled down into a definite tax bracket.  Take care of Central American situation -- things are getting confused there.  The CIA is losing its image.  The media is exploiting problems and not creating a good image.  Russia right now is into Central America taking over.  They'll slowly working their way up here; we have to be firmly patient.  Be on better relations with Russia.  Pollution -- we dump chemical waste into the ocean.  Slowly but surely we are poisoning ourselves and wildlife.  They are getting more and more extinct; whales and other species are threatened.  There's no excuse to kill these animals.  Japan, Iceland and Russia ought to wake up."
23,"Too much crime in the nation.  It was a disaster to take prayer out of the school.  People have misplaced God.  If a man has high morals, God and knows Jesus, we would not have to talk about any other problems.  Keep out the illegal aliens and don't let them (aliens) take away our Social Security.  They can be here only a few months and draw from the fund that people have paid into for years.  That is bankrupting the nation.  Immigration should be severely restricted.  To support that load with government handouts is bankrupting our nation."
25,The deficit/interest -- what bothers me is the pay rate young people are getting.  The interest rates they have to pay; everything they buy is high.  They can't enjoy a decent standard of living unless both work in the family.  The nuclear threat -- it is great.  It's like if we stood in a barrel of gas with 3 matched and we get another barrel of gas.  What good will that do.  Why keep on buying more and more nuclear weapons?  The main threat is between minority countries.  They couldn't make it look like an accident and start a war between Russia and the U. S.
26,"No jobs, no work everybody closing up places of unemployment and leaves everybody without jobs. Unions and strikes  cause it because they want more money and it messes up everybody else. I think old unions should be cut out of every place. They want to cut off social security and medicare for older people. We shouldn't have any wars unless our own country is at war and we shouldn't feed people in foreign countries we should feed our own people first make sure they have what they need . When forcing countries fight among themselves, we should stay out of it. Nobody knows what going to happen, no jobs and things aren't  getting better. People have committed suicide and killed their families because they last their homes and every thing, also the foreign countries We're helping will come over and kill us when they get on their feet, They've  no compassion for other countries."
27,"The problems of unemployment -- at present the unemployment rate is 6% and I think, realistically, if it stays at 6% or drops to 5%, we will have addressed the needs of those people who wish to work.  If it goes above 6%, we'll have a problem.  The possibility of a recession -- as long as we can keep the cost of living index at about 3 1/2% to 4%; as long as we can keep the unemployment factor at 5% to 6% ; and as long as we keep the gross national product base at about 3% a year, this country will not suffer through a recession.  If any of these factors do change radically, we could anticipate a mild recession.  Balance of the trade deficit -- presently our imports exceed our exports by 120 billion dollars this year.  We've got to try either to impose some quotas on the imports or convince the foreign countries to accept a greater portion of our exports.  To continue this trend, which this past year has been the worst, can only lead to the further erosion of jobs in the U. S."
28,"Poverty as an old folks and environment waste, chemical and human waste, trash, all kinds of waste. There's the nuclear bomb the big one. There should be one no Oh school systems they're lacking in funds the kids aren't being taught properly. The methods are ancient they've been trying to teach them all the same way and it doesn't work. I know a lot of kids who can learn but not in school 016 and the teachers are striking and that doesn't leave much for the kids they're not really well paid though, so what does the govt expect and that's a hard job too."
29,"Economy well, interest rates the unemployment. I think sometime we have too many federal programs. I think it's about time the U.S stop and listen to Americans problems as opposed to helping all these foreign countries. I fully lealize this is a free country, we nee to limit the aliens, after 1 year they should be required to take citizenship, were supporting too many people. Yes income tax on elderly should be exonerated, from paying all taxes, because they've paid taxes all their life. High cost of hospitals, nursing homes and medicine, it's for too much for people on a fixed income, I don't know what solution should be. Every town should try to help, through with senior services."
33,Agriculture -- I'm from a farming community and I am concerned about what's happening to farmers.  Financially they are finding it impossible to keep going.  There are families that are going bankrupt; caught up in the economic trends and can't get out.  Foreign policy -- I am concerned with the nuclear arms race; the power struggle is out of our hands and control.  National Debt -- I don't know what it would take to balance a budget.  Families and businesses have to contend with a profit or loss.  There has to be something we can do on a national level to keep economics affairs more in balance.
34,"The economy -- the prices, even though the economy has improved, the economy is dwindling.  Interest rates are hish.  So you should cut spending so that the economy will go down, so that there will more unemployment.  Inflation -- the price of goods are going to rise, so the inflation rate will start increasing again.  The national debt -- it is so high that we will be paying so much interest the value of money will be extinct.  Import deficit -- it is 38 billion dollars.  Money is going to other countries."
35,"We're losing our middle-class people.  Inflation.  The national debt.  Our federal reserve system.  Foreign trade -- I think it's a sin the way we allow other countries to manufacture goods for the American people and our people are out those jobs.  The feelings of the rest of the world about the Americans -- there are bad feelings and there's a reason, the average citizen isn't being told the truth by our government.  The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and also the middle class is getting poorer.  We see more jobs at minimum wages and low income yet prices of goods continues to go up.  Federal reserve system controls the world which is bad!"
41,"Inflation. The social security. Whether social security's going to be a continuing possibility in the time to come. when I retire will I get any money? Well my kids get any money. Foreign affairs. The problem in Nicaragua the far east our relations w/ The Soviet Union, the use of the bomb is tried in with that. I'm sure that there are but on taxation I'd like to see taxation in the UN. Not just one country but total participation in the UN and the concert. If they did that, they'd have their handful."
42,"Stabilizing true equality for the citizens. No that's what I think is the biggest problem true equality going toward that goal. We're developing a class structure that is going to be destructive. No the other issues will resolve themselves or the govt will go to war. That's the thing that's tearing the country apart. The deficit nuclear weapons a lack of concetration on science in the right direction using govt and to explore destructive areas father than positive addressing the pollution of the country clearing up the environment and cities of america , how we handle it."
43,The budget -- needs to be balanced.  I think we will probably have to pay out more taxes to balance it; more cuts in nationally funded organizations.  I'm afraid unemployment may rise.  Defense --  I have mixed feelings; I hope Reagan will have a strong posture on national defense.  The armament race -- there seems to be a strong nuclear arms race between all the countries.  Civil rights -- I would like to see more action on equal pay for comparable work and would like to hear less about discrimination.
