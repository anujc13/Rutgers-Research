0,1. The deficit: The amount of deficit has an effect on the value of dollar and interest rates. The effect is we're buying more foreign goods.                                                     2. Unemployment: Unemployment is going to go higher unless deficit is reduced. The gov should make sure there is as little.           3. The decline of the north east economically businesses are moving out of northeast to the south west. The N.E. is losing its tax base.                                                          4. Balancing the budget I don't think there should be a law passed to balance budget. but the deficit should be limited.
2,"The national debt, high interest rates, the arms control and nuclear weapons is probably the most important. I don't think it's going to go down, I don't see how they are going to control it without raising taxes. Reagan never said what he was going to do that's what I don't like about him. High interest, hard for young people to get homes. Rich people getting richer. They control all the money. Nuclear arms, it is a problem I don't know how they are going to control it. I don't know the answer, it's serious."
3,"The budget deficit, defense, social programs. I feel the budget deficit is creating a host of other problems. Such as keeping interest rates high, effecting our balance of trade and these together, in turn, effect employment and job security. I think the national security is extremely important but I think a phenomenal amount of money is wasted in national defense. I think we can be strong without throwing money down the drain, money that can go a long way instead toward balancing the national budget and cutting the deficit. There have been to many cuts in too many social programs and many people who are victims of economic conditions  are left on their own. I don't think that's right."
4,The agricultural plight. The farmers are either going to have to get more for their good or something else well have and change. I don't know what that has to be done without increasing the final cost to the consumer and unions are pretty. Well in check now gotten under control and one big problems the careless attitude of a lot of the population concerning their obligation financially as well as normally. Bankruptcy has become an everyday word. It too easy and morally the public indifference to the elections and the critical differences in the campaign such as abortion. I despise people who take bankruptcy it a cowardly way out eventually. Lenders will refuse credit to anyone because they can not continue to loose funds and stay in businesses and if people are so determined to borrow money they should be just as determined to pay it back. I'm pro life.
5,"Influx of people costing government so much money to care for Vietanamian and mexicans, they are even getting cared for better than people who lived here 100 yrs or more. Distribution of wealth some old thing rich get richer and poor get poorer. No matter how poor they should have decent standard living. Good job can't buy home or support family like it should. Spending too much money on space. Loaning too much money to foreign nations when they should know there's no hope of return. Stirring up small countries in older to sell them (not legible) equipment."
8,"The deficit- how to lower the federal deficit. Foreign affairs- Nicaragua is in the news a lot. Inflation and high interest rates. I think military waste is a big problem which goes back to deficit problem. My husband sees a lot of that like the price of ladders they use which is the same thing and a lot cheaper at the hardware store. I think it's important now that the election is over to get together, everybody work together- mend the fences. I still hear a lot of hard feelings- argument about taxes- about whether Russia is a threat in Nicaragua, sending planes or not. Inflation and interest rates still too high and always fear they will go up instead of down."
11,"Unemployment -- people need work and jobs and they can't get them.  The reports say that unemployment is less now so they don't pay attention to the places that have.  Interest rates -- they are too high for homes and loans.  Older people -- their medicare needs to be worked on.  If an older person goes in the hospital, the medicare only pays a part of it.  They just stop there even is the people have to stay in the hospital a long time.  The elderly can't afford the bills and their families have to bear the responsibility."
12,"Our deficit which is god awful. Our perception overseas appears to be a little sell serving. Well in Lebanon we say one thing and then pull out, Grands was a bit of grandstanding I thought and a terrible one of in south america. I can't believe Nicaragua thinks we're joint to invade them and we should have some kind of relation with Russia. The nuclear arms race of course we have to talk to the Russia. The nuclear freeze is idealistic it won't happen in our lifetime. I'm very much against women not being able to have abortions when they want of if they can't afford them those are the most important."
13,"Imports, steel is down, anti industry down trying to break up the unions and coal miners. Imports the steel mills is coming in from other. Countries and we aren't working. all the japanese cars here. Japanese are taking over keeping our people from working. Unions bringing japanese with there anti mobiles and trying to break down our unions. My daddy was a [REDACTED INDUSTRY] my husband is a [REDACTED INDUSTRY] and they are just killing us taking our jobs away. The govt don't care they just let the foreigners take over."
15,"Hunger:  There are mostly children and older people without sufficient food.  People on Welfare:  I think they should all have a job from the government even if it means digging ditches.  The government should get them a job.  There have been too many people on welfare for generations.  Lindberg Law:  What happened to it?  We have all these children who are being kidnapped, raped and hurt.  The person doing the crime is found insane and let out in five years.  Peace:  We should try to control peace within our nation before we try to find peace out of our nation.  Indians:  I think the Indians should have more privileges than they do.  After all, they were our first Americans.  I don't think we should allow foreign people to buy land - only lease it for 99 years.  The drug problem should be controlled by instituting a clinic where users can be counseled and helped.  With a legalized clinic, the crimes rate will greatly be reduced."
