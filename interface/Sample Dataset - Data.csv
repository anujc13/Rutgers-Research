1984,Post,2,imp_US_probs,H2,Economy -- getting out of debt. Education -- I feel that we have a problem and it needs analyzing. Too much permissive passing; we should teach people how to read and our teachers are not teaching. Communism in this hemisphere -- I'm afraid of the spread of communism.
1984,Post,3,imp_US_probs,H2,"Abortion, the national deficit and arms control. What I mean to say was nuclear war- I think we should be up with other countries as far as that's concerned. We should have as many nuclear arms as Russia does. Abortion, it should not be legal unless it is a case of rape or incest. National defense, how the country should pay its national debt is a big Q, a big problem."
1984,Post,4,imp_US_probs,H2,"People having more jobs, companies stop laying off so many people. Unemployment around the country. That's the main one."
1984,Post,5,imp_US_probs,H2,"National debt -- both federal and state legislatures have literally spent us into a state of bankruptcy. You can only tax the people so far; chaos will be the result. Trying to win the arms race with Russia is idiotic. The Russian prophecy that ""capitalists will bury themselves without a shot being fired"" will prove itself true."
1984,Post,6,imp_US_probs,H2,Still financial deficit and personal situations that are affected by interest rates.
1984,Post,7,imp_US_probs,H2,Nuclear warfare -- that's what will end the world in years to come.
1984,Post,8,imp_US_probs,H2,"Peace -- covers a lot of things. Health and welfare -- medicare; general employment taking care of the elderly. The young, those not able to help themselves. Balance the budget. Crime."
1984,Post,9,imp_US_probs,H2,"Foreign relations, economics, unemployment. There are a lot of others those are the main ones I think."
1984,Post,10,imp_US_probs,H2,"Peace in the world and in our country feeding the hungry in our country and world, prevention of nuclear holocaust. these are the major ones."
1984,Post,11,imp_US_probs,H2,The fear of nuclear war.
1984,Post,12,imp_US_probs,H2,National debt. Foreign policy concerning central america and the Russians.
1984,Post,13,imp_US_probs,H2,"Deficit; arms race -- internationally; feeding people here; country's identity problem -- people have become too fragmented, we need a dose of old-fashioned American, restore the melting pot image; plain language needed."
1984,Post,14,imp_US_probs,H2,Balancing the budget and the federal deficit. Our stance on arms control. I'm concerned that we might be leading the arms race.
1984,Post,15,imp_US_probs,H2,Our foreign policy with Russian and with central America. It's very touchy and hard to solve and the budget deficit must come down which will improve the economy.
1984,Pre,1,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,Spend too much money.
1984,Pre,2,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"The great giveaway program It's not like they really mean it. In an election year, you're not going to find anyone, Democrat or Republican, voting against Social Security. I dislike political motivation. I'd like to see someone vote his conscience occasionally."
1984,Pre,5,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,Reputation for spending and not showing where to get the money. Always had a reputation for enlarging the bureaucracy of government.
1984,Pre,7,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,They all spend too much money.
1984,Pre,9,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"I disagree with many of their policies. Their economic policies tend to want to solve peoples problems by the use of the government and spending money. So far as foreign policy is concerned, I think they are softer on communism."
1984,Pre,12,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"The way they are handling the presidential campaign. They lack direction. Mondale has switched horses and tried to change his personality and this should have been thought of long ago. Not organized, a lack of ironing out the details of the campaign before they got into it."
1984,Pre,13,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,They forget about everyone other than the little man. They pick up a small group such as gays and they keep forgetting they represent the whole society. Their platforms are designed to help the small groups.
1984,Pre,15,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,They are too liberal. The welfare state got out of hand. I feel it's been too much of a handout to minorities.
1984,Pre,25,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"For this election, there's no backbone in the party. The 3 candidates that they are running before the Democratic convention might have had a better chance of winning if they weren't Democrats. If they were running on independent tickets. The nation is looking for a leader instead of putting a party in office."
1984,Pre,26,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"It's lack of organization, lack of focus."
1984,Pre,30,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,Liberal aspects. Republicans closer to my conservative nature. Government programs involving government spending. Liberal philosophy which I don't like.
1984,Pre,31,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"When things get better and the economy is back, they don't like to stop their programs. Then everything gets abused."
1984,Pre,32,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"Sometimes they are a little too liberal. They go a little bit overboard on social programs. They give a little bit too much of our money to the people who are not working, who could work, then they should."
1984,Pre,34,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"If the Democratic party were in or were to go in, we would be in war very shortly. Feel we would have a welfare state even greater than we have now. We'd have higher taxes. The economy would be poorer, prices higher."
1984,Pre,35,dislike_pty_dem,K2a,"Basically, too liberal. In the past they have been founder of the Great Society. People should work. Welfare recipients should work if they are physically able for what they get."
